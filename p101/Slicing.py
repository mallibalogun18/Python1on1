# The concept of slicing in Python
# Star, Stop, Step

# STAR and STOP slicing
name = 'Lebron James'

print(name[0:4])  # Lebr - prints our from the element at 0 not including the element at 4 (RULE: Up to but not
# including).
print(name[2:9])  # bron Ja
# in slicing you can also use negative integers and you can using two elements is not required. With negative
# indexing you can't go backwards. It should also be noted that in slicing, when using a negative integer,
# the rule "UP TO BUT NOT" is backwards
print(name[:10])  # Lebron Jam
